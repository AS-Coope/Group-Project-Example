            <p> Computer Science is the study of how computers work and how they apply to different aspects in life. 
                I use my computer everyday, and my computer works when data is coded to process into information 
                for me to see!
            </p>
            <p>Based on what I've learnt, I know that coding can help me become a software engineer,
                a backend engineer and many other jobs. However, I would like to become a software engineer
                as I love the problem solving process and would like to build software that directly solves 
                issues that are faced in my community.
